# ECommerce
A simple microservices-based .NET e-commerce web application, created for a LinkedIn Learning course given by [Rodrigo Dias Concha](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/rodrigo-diaz-concha?u=106240434). The code is complete up to chapter 4 of the course.

The app contains microservices for customers, orders, and products. It also has the functionality to search for information on specific customers, returning information about the customer themselves and all orders they have made. To do so, the user must send a POST request to the search API with the desired customer's ID.
